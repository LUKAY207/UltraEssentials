# UltraEssentialsTP

[ MADE IN AUSTRIA by LUKAYÂ© ]

    Since the EssentialsTP hasn't been developed further for a long time, 
    I decided to code a plugin with even more features on the PocketMine-MP API5. 
    More features will be added over time.

At the moment the plugin has the following features:

> - /tpa <player> (Sends a teleport request to a player)
> - /tpahere <player> (Sends a teleport here request to a player)
> - /tpaccept (Accepts a '/tpa' or '/tpahere')
> - /tpadecline (Declines a '/tpa' or '/tpahere')
> - /tpall (Teleports all online players to you)
> - /vanish <player> (Turns vanish on)
> - /unvanish <player> (Turns vanish off)
> - /home <home> (Teleports you to chosen home)
> - /homes (Shows you a list of all homes created by a player)
> - /sethome <home> (Sets a home)
> - /deletehome <home> (Deletes a home)
> - /heal <player> (Heals a player)
> - /feed <player> (Feeds a player)
> - /account <player> (Shows information about a player)
> - /nick <nickname> (Gives you a nick)
> - /unick <player> (Unsets the nick of the chosen player)
